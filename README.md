# sticky-notes-app with React
## Overview
This project concerns a sticky note app that the user can utilise to memorise their To-Do's, as part of a project of my web development bootcamp.
### Directions 
- Download the src and public folders.
- Open command prompt or powershell and navigate to a folder of interest using the change directory (cd) command.
- In there type:  `npx create-react-app my-app` where "my-app" will be the name of the app folder.
- In that newly created folder delete the src and public folders and move the previously downloaded folders in.
- In powershell or command prompt, navigate in the "my-app" folder by using the "cd" command.
- Type `npm start` to start the React project. A new browser window should pop up and display the Sticky Notes App.
